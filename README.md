# BundesligaPrediction
Full pipeline for predicting Bundesliga matches. Including automated data collection, feature engeneering and model training/testing.

The script gets all Bundesliga matches in a specified time and trains a prediction model based on the data. It automatically uses upcoming games in the data to make predictions. The predictions can be viewed in the console or visualised by usind the app.py which will allow you to view them on a local website.


Note: The code was formatted and commented with Google Gemini 2.5 pro after finishing the project.
